Description: Javascript unit test runner
 Testswarm provides distributed continuous integration testing for JavaScript.
 .
 The primary goal of TestSwarm is to take the complicated, and time-consuming,
 process of running JavaScript test suites in multiple browsers and to grossly
 simplify it. It achieves this goal by providing all the tools necessary for
 creating a continuous integration workflow for your JavaScript project.
